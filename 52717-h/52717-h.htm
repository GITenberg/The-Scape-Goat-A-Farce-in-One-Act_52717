</div>
<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Scene</span>—<i>Polyglot’s study. A door on each side, conducting
to other apartments. An opening to the
garden, at the back of the stage. Another door
leading to the interior of the house. Globes, books,
maps, &amp;c. are scattered about.</i></p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Robin</span> <i>discovered, turning a globe</i>.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'><i>Robin.</i> ’Tis an extraordinary thing, that, do what I
will, I can’t make myself sensible. I turn the world
topsy-turvy for hours together, as I see my young
master, Mr. Charles, do; like Mr. Ignatius Polyglot,
his tutor, I sometimes look into a book full of Greek or
Latin; but all to no purpose. Ah! Mr. Polyglot must
be in the right: he can’t bear the sight of a woman in
the house, for fear Mr. Charles should fall in love, and
neglect his studies; and, for my part, I’m sure that, if
all the Greek I have got in my pocket (<i>shewing a book</i>)
were cramm’d into my head, one thought of my sweet
little Somersetshire lass, Molly Maggs, would drive it
out again.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><i>Enter</i> <span class='sc'>Molly Maggs</span>, <i>from the Garden</i>.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'><i>Molly.</i> Hist! hist! Robin!</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Robin.</i> What! my dear Molly! You may come in.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Molly.</i> I’m afeard, Robin.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Robin.</i> There’s nothing to be afraid of just now.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Molly.</i> Where’s Mr<a id='tn005'></a>. Ignoramus, the tutorer, then?</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span><i>Robin.</i> Mr. Ignatius you mean. He’s out, taking
his evening’s walk.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Molly.</i> Be he? I hope he be gone down towards the
little bridge.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Robin.</i> Why?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Molly.</i> The last time he went that way, he were so
busy at what he called soldering a problem, that he
stumbled over into the brook. If I had been in your
place, Robin, before I pulled him out again I’d ha’
made him promise to consent to our marriage, or I’d
ha’ let him bide there till doomsday.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Robin.</i> Molly, Molly, you don’t like Mr. Polyglot.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Molly.</i> Why don’t he like me then?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Robin.</i> It is not you alone, but he would dislike any
other young maiden about the house the same.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Molly.</i> And what for? there’s no reason in that.
Am I to blame? I’m sure ’tis no fault of mine, Robin,
that I’m a young maiden. Ha! ha! ha! A pretty
to-do there’d be if he should catch me here—in his
own apartments too!</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Robin.</i> So there would. I tremble to think of it;
and so, Molly, you’d better—</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Molly.</i> I don’t care: if he says any thing to me, I’ll
give him his own. Besides, our master, old Master
Eustace, will be home in a few days, and we’ll ask his
leave to be married, in spite of old tutorer.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Robin.</i> No, no, we must not displease him; he’s
steward as well as tutorer, and—</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Molly.</i> He’ll discharge us? let him. I’m not afeard
of wanting a service. I have relations who are up in
the world. I’m first cousin to Sally Maggs, who is
head chambermaid at the Bell, at Winchester—Chattering
Sally, as they call her, and well they may, for
she is chatter, chatter, chatter—</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Robin.</i> In that respect, Molly, you don’t disgrace
the relationship.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Molly.</i> Discharge us, indeed! the sooner the better;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>we may then get married when we please. What
does the foolish old chap mean by not liking folks to
marry? I wish his father had been of the same mind,
and then Mr. Ignoramus would not have been here to
torment us.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Robin.</i> Well, well, though he is a little crabbed
and sour, he’s a good old soul at bottom. He’d go
through fire and water to serve young Master Charles.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Molly.</i> With a vengeance! Poor young gentleman!
he’s grown as melancholy as a willow tree: and no
wonder: at four-and-twenty to be kept in leading-strings
like a baby! But no good will come of it, see
if there do; and I wish that Master Charles would
give him the slip one of these days, on purpose to
plague him. O, if I could but catch the old one
doing any thing amiss—</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Robin.</i> Think kindlier of him, Molly; we’ll wait
till we find him in a good humour, and then perhaps—</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Molly.</i> If we wait till then, Robin, you need be in
no hurry to buy the wedding ring. Well, I’ll go.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Robin.</i> Do; for after all ’twould do no good to
anger him. And, Lord! if he were to see us here
together!-Well, good bye, my dear Molly.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Molly.</i> Good bye, Robin! (<i>loitering</i>) Good bye,
Robin!</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Robin.</i> (<i>Kisses her</i>) Bless your little heart!</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'><i>Molly.</i> O, crimini!</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> What do I behold! Under my nose! my
very nose! here too! in my study, the sanctuary of
science and of learning!</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Molly.</i> Well, if nothing worse was ever learnt here,
Mr. Ignoramus—</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> Ignatius.—But what atonement can you make
for this?</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span><i>Molly.</i> Atonement! I’ve done nothing to atone for.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> Nothing! Do you call that nothing? Did I
not see? Did I not hear? Nothing! <i>O tem</i>—but you
don’t understand Latin.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Molly.</i> Latin, indeed! no, nor Greek neither; and
I’m sure ’tis all Greek you are talking to me. What
did you see? what did you hear? You heard Robin
say good bye, that was all.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> Peace! I’m a linguist, and in none of the
seventeen languages I’m acquainted with, does that
mean good bye.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Molly.</i> Then I wouldn’t give seventeen figs to be
as learned as you are, and your seventeen languages
are not worth talking.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> To what is the poor youth exposed! Mischief!
Serpent! Woman! I pity, and tremble for, the unfortunate
lad.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Molly.</i> ’Tis a misfortune not likely to happen to you.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> But ’tis I alone who am to blame. I ought
not to have allowed one of the deluding sex to approach
those innocent and unsuspecting youths. Had my
pupil, Charles, beheld this, it might have put things
into his head, which—But there will yet be time to
save them. To-morrow, at day-break, you will quit
this house.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Molly.</i> Nay, and you wouldn’t be so cruel, Mr.
Poll-parrot.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> Polyglot.—I have said it; reply not.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Molly.</i> I have not done any harm, and I’m sure I
did not think any harm. ’Tis no fault of mine if
Robin is in love with me: he fell in love of his own
accord, indeed he did.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> Love! (<i>looks fearfully about.</i>) Silence!—If
Charles should hear that dangerous word—Retire—Withdraw—begone.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Molly.</i> (<i>Bursting into tears.</i>) O dearee me! Pray,
good, kind Mr. Ignoramus, forgive me this once.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>Would you have it upon your conscience to turn a
poor lass out of her service, and send her upon the
wide world without a friend to protect her? Would’ee
now, Mr. Ignoramus, would’ee?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> Go away, my dear, and—No, I will not give
way to the weakness of our common nature, but prove
myself, in the discharge of my duty, inflexible as the
first Brutus!</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Molly.</i> And well you may call him so, if he was as
stony-hearted as you are. Will you forgive me?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> No!</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Molly.</i> You won’t? Nay, then, I’ll tell you a bit
of my mind; I’ll do that, an’ I die for it. For all your
grave looks, I’ll be sworn you are no better than your
neighbours; I know you arn’t. I’ll pass my days in
watching you, I will; and if ever I catch you saying
“good bye,” as I know I shall, then, when you are in
trouble, and in need of indulgence, you shall find me
as pityless as yourself. There; carry that bundle
upon your shoulders, and now—I’ll go and pack up
mine.</p>

<div class='c015'>[<i>Exit.</i></div>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> The little serpent! Her tears, her imploring
looks, had well nigh—But I must be firm: I see the
danger, and must protect my pupil against the snares
of these pernicious creatures. Poor lad! he is innocent,
and knows not the seductive power of love. My
example and instructions have so fortified his mind, so
hardened his heart against all silly, soft impressions,
that, thanks to me, he may hope to pass through life
as becomes a philosopher—in a happy indifference to
all its joys, its pleasures, and its cares. He comes!—My
dear disciple!</p>

    <div><i>Enter</i> <span class='sc'>Charles</span>, <i>in violent agitation</i>.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'><i>Charles.</i> My dear sir, I’m glad you are returned.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> Your impatience pleases me. Come, is it
to be Sophocles this evening?</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span><i>Charles.</i> No:—it is not that, sir,—but—</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> Well, well; we must sometimes relax,—make
holiday; so, instead of Sophocles, we’ll amuse ourselves
with a problem in Euclid.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Charles.</i> Confound Euclid! as he has often confounded
me. No, sir; I—in short, you see me in the
greatest distress.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> In distress! You alarm me! My dear boy,
my dear child, what is the matter?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Charles.</i> My father is returning; he is now galloping
up the avenue, and I see no refuge from my difficulties
but in death.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> Mercy on me! what do you mean? No
refuge but in—and in his father’s absence too! Consider,
that for all that concerns you, I am responsible.
Wait, at least, till he arrives, and—</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Charles.</i> No, I am resolved; the matter is pressing,
and there’s no time for deliberation.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> And he has not half finished his studies!
(<i>Rushes into his arms</i>) Charles—my dear boy—be composed—look
at me—who am I? have I not been your
guide, your protector, your friend, since the hour you
were born. You know I love you; that there is nothing
on earth I would not do to see you happy; tell
me, then, what it is afflicts you.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Charles.</i> You will betray me to my father, and I
dread his displeasure worse than death.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> Betray you! Never; be it what it may.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Charles.</i> Swear!</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> I never swear.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Charles.</i> Swear, or this instant will I—</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> Hold! your danger inspires me with the
devotion of an antique Roman: I swear, (<i>raising his
hand</i>) <i>Per Jovem!</i> By Jupiter! I swear.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Charles.</i> Enough! I will trust you. (<i>Aside</i>) And
yet I dare not tell him the whole.—I—I am in love.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> O, horror! In love! ’Tis epidemic—’tis running
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>through the house! Robin, Molly, and now—How,
sir! and at your age, only just turned of four-and-twenty;
the thing is incredible, and—</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Charles.</i> Do but hear me, sir.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> In love! it cannot be: why, he has Greek,
Latin, algebra, and mathematics at his finger’s ends.
And is this the termination of my hopes? You, whom
I destined for a philosopher; you, whose name I
fondly hoped to see placed side by side with the glorious
names of Archimedes and Aristotle! Did love
find out the square of the hypothenuse? Did love—</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Charles.</i> O, sir, if the bare avowal of my affection
so displease you, what will you say when I confess to
you that—but here comes my father. (<i>Aside.</i>) Where
shall I conceal my dear Harriet?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> Be composed; he must not observe our
agitation.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Charles.</i> Remember your promise, or I’ll keep
mine. Pop!</p>

    <div><i>Enter</i> <span class='sc'>Old Eustace</span>, <i>followed by</i> <span class='sc'>Robin</span>, <i>to whom he gives his great-coat, hat and whip</i>.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'><i>Eustace.</i> Charles, my boy, I’m glad to see you.
Mr. Polyglot, my worthy friend, your hand. You did
not expect to see me so soon.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> No, sir, we—we didn’t expect you till last
week.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Eustace.</i> Till next week, you mean. The truth is,
I was willing to take you by surprise, and see how
things had been managed during my absence; but I
might have spared myself the trouble. You, Mr.
Polyglot, have the superintendance of my servants,
and are accountable for their conduct;—</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Robin.</i> Don’t tell about Molly and me, sir. (<i>Aside
to Polyglot.</i>)</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span><i>Eustace.</i> My son is under your especial care and
observance;—</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Charles.</i> Remember! (<i>Aside to Polyglot.</i>)</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Eustace.</i> And so perfect is my reliance on your
attention, prudence, and wisdom, that I am persuaded
you have nothing to relate of what has passed in the
house that will not receive my fullest approbation.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> Yes—no—certainly.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Eustace.</i> Well, Charles, my arrival must not interrupt
your studies; retire to your own room till supper
is ready. Mr. Polyglot, I have something of importance
to communicate to you. Robin, desire the cook
to be expeditious; my ride has given me an appetite:
and do you put lights into my study: after supper, I
shall be occupied there for an hour or two.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Charles.</i> (<i>Stops Robin as he is going off.</i>) What,
sir! the pavilion at the end of the garden?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Eustace.</i> Ay, I have no other.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Charles.</i> You had better not go there to-night, sir;
’tis damp, and—</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Eustace.</i> Damp? nonsense! Robin, do as I desire.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Charles.</i> (<i>Aside.</i>) ’Tis there I have concealed her.
There is not a moment to be lost.</p>

<div class='c015'>[<i>Exit.</i></div>

<p class='c014'><i>Robin.</i> (<i>Whispers <a id='tn012'></a>to Polyglot.</i>) Be kind to
poor Molly, and forgive her, sir.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> (<i>Lost in thought.</i>) No, Molly—yes, Robin, yes.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Robin.</i> Thankye, sir; it shall never happen again.</p>

<div class='c015'>[<i>Exit.</i></div>

<p class='c014'><i>Eustace.</i> Why, what is the meaning of all this?
Tell me, Mr. Polyglot, what is the matter here? This
confusion, and whispering!—Surely my sudden arrival
cannot have occasioned any inconvenience. I expected
to see you all delighted, and you receive me with faces
as long as my arm.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> Uncommonly long! uncommonly long!</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Eustace.</i> (<i>Aside.</i>) I perceive: the philosopher is in
one of his fits of abstraction.—But there is an air of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>restraint about Charles, for which I am at a loss to
account. Has he done any thing to provoke your
displeasure?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> (<i>Aside.</i>) I dare not inform him.—No, no—a
trifle.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Eustace.</i> You are right to be severe with him: he
is now arrived at an age when the strictest watchfulness
over his conduct is necessary. Ah! Mr. Polyglot,
your example has made him what he is; your vigilance
must keep him so.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> I—you flatter me.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Eustace.</i> I will now, in few words, confide to you
the object of the journey from which I have just returned:
it was to make arrangements for the marriage
of my son.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> His marriage!</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Eustace.</i> I anticipate your objection, and will
answer it.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> I have no objection to offer. (<i>Aside.</i>) Then
it turns out as it should be. Charles is already in love;
so the marriage comes opportunely.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Eustace.</i> No objection! Why, till now, you have
always held that no man ought to marry till he’s sixty;
that is to say, till he has finished his education, and
seen a little of the world.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> You make a slight mistake; I always said,
at least I meant to say, four-and-twenty.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Eustace.</i> Well, I’m glad it is so; for, to say the
truth, although I am of your opinion, that it is not
prudent to marry whilst a mere baby, yet I always
thought sixty somewhat of the latest.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> Ay, ay, for a young man it is, but—(<i>Aside</i>)
What a relief is this to my mind! How happy this
will make my dear boy!</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Eustace.</i> I’m delighted to find you are of my
opinion. Next week I’ll take Charles to town with
me; he shall see the young lady; I do not mean to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>control his choice; but if he like her, and she like
him, they shall marry instantly.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> Like her! my dear sir, I’m happy to tell you
that he is already in—(<i>Aside.</i>) My oath—<i>per Jovem!</i></p>

<p class='c014'><i>Eustace.</i> Come, Mr. Polyglot, follow me to the
supper room; we’ll talk further of this. I can never
repay you, my good friend, for your care of my son.
As I said before, your example has made him what he
is: for his virtues he is indebted to you; and, were it
possible he could be guilty of any crime or folly, so
completely is he under your guidance, that I should
hold you more to blame than him.</p>

<div class='c015'>[<i>Exit.</i></div>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> What a fortunate turn has this affair taken!
Since he is in love, he must naturally be anxious to
marry. Yet he did not tell me with whom he is in
love. I do not pretend to understand those matters;
but I presume that, being in love, he wants a wife,
and—Oh! there can’t be a doubt of it; so long as he
get a wife, surely it can’t signify who. He comes;
I’ll communicate the joyful tidings to him.</p>

    <div><i>Enter</i> <span class='sc'>Charles</span>, <i>in violent agitation</i>.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'><i>Charles.</i> I have been anxiously waiting the departure
of my father.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> My dear boy, quiet your apprehensions; ’tis
all right.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Charles.</i> ’Tis all wrong, and fifty times worse than
before.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> What mean you?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Charles.</i> The unexpected arrival of my father has
thrown me into a difficulty scarcely surmountable.
Alas! you know but half my unhappy story.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> I hope then it is the worst half, for really I
have suffered—</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Charles.</i> I tremble to avow to you the full extent of
my folly, and yet I dare no longer conceal any circumstance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>of it from you. The urgency of our situation,
the danger that awaits us—</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> Come, come, courage; tell me all.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Charles.</i> Know then, that having become acquainted
with a young lady, the orphan daughter of an officer
in the army, I grew enamoured of her, was assiduous
in my attentions to her, succeeded in winning her
affections, and finally—</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> Eh? What!—say no more—Oh! Charles,
Charles—</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Charles.</i> Do but hear me to the end of my story.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> I have heard too much already. And are these
the fruits of my instructions? Is it by such wickedness
you repay my anxious care of you?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Charles.</i> You mistake me, sir; if you would but
listen—</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> Never expect from me either pardon or indulgence.
Had you indeed formed such a bond of union
as might without a blush have been acknowledged, it
is possible I might—</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Charles.</i> What, sir! would you have sanctioned
our marriage? Obtained for us my father’s pardon, his
approbation?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> In that case, perhaps, I would have interfered
in your behalf; for marriage is a sacred contract, and
must be respected: but, as it is—</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Charles.</i> (<i>Joyfully.</i>) Then my worthy Mentor, my
best of friends, be comforted: I <i>am</i> married.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> (<i>Struck with astonishment.</i>) Married!</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Charles.</i> I am, I am. Marriage, as you say, is a
sacred contract; and, by your own shewing, you are
bound to assist us.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> Married! So vigilant as I have been, yet has
he contrived to—I must at once reveal this to your
father. (<i>Going.</i>)</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Charles.</i> And your oath!</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> Oh!</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span><i>Charles.</i> Betray me, and my life, my dear wife’s
too, may become a sacrifice. But no, you will not;
for your own sake, you dare not. Upon you alone will
fall the blame.—Under whose especial care have I
been placed? <a id='tn016'></a>Yours. Whose duty was it to watch
over my conduct? <a id='tn016-2'></a>Yours. Whose vigilance was at
fault when I could contrive a secret marriage? <a id='tn016-3'></a>Yours.
My father has made you responsible for my actions:
<i>ergo</i>: it is against you alone that my father will
manifest his displeasure at my misconduct.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> (<i>His countenance gradually betraying his
satisfaction.</i>) The dear boy! He is indebted to me
for his logic. Aristotle himself would have been proud
of such a pupil. That’s something like conducting an
argument. I have not a word to reply.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Charles.</i> But there is no time to be lost; you must
at once decide. If you consent to protect us, we shall
for ever consider you our friend—our saviour. You
shall pass your days with us; we will be a comfort to
your age; our children shall thank you; and, as you
moulded their father’s mind, so shall you give the bent
to their’s.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> My dear Charles, I will encounter anything
for your sake: whatever may befal me, I swear not to
betray your interests. This will be a sad disappointment
to your father. You must allow me a few days
to consider the best mode of breaking the affair to him.
But where have you left your—it was only this morning
I rapped his knuckles for a false quantity—your wife?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Charles.</i> Left her? She’s here!</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> What, here! in the house?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Charles.</i> In my father’s study, in the garden. Taking
advantage of his absence, I have, for many days, concealed
her there; but his sudden return compels me to
seek some other retreat for her. Aided by the growing
darkness, I have removed her. She is waiting there in
the garden. I will confide her to your care.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span><i>Poly.</i> Hold, hold! Confide a woman to my care!</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Charles.</i> Ay; your apartment is the most secure.
No one will suspect that a female is concealed there.
(<i>Runs towards the garden.</i>) Harriet, Harriet! This
way.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> (<i>In great consternation.</i>) Stay—what would
you do? Should she be discovered here, I’m ruined,
undone!—Oh! she’s here!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><i>Enter</i> <span class='sc'>Harriet</span>.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'><i>Charles.</i> Fear nothing, my darling love; this is our
best friend.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Harriet.</i> In what terms can we express our gratitude,
sir?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> Indeed, miss—mistress—my good lady, I—my
head is turning—But, tell me, Charles, how did
you contrive, without my knowledge, to—</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Charles.</i> My wife will explain all to you. In the
mean time I’ll keep watch without. Should my father
take us by surprise, all will be lost. My good, kind
friend, I confide to your care all I value in the world—my
own dear Harriet.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> Why—why—you would not leave me alone
with her?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Charles.</i> (<i>Not attending to him.</i>) Be composed,
love; all will be well.</p>

<div class='c015'>[<i>Exit.</i></div>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> Charles, Charles! Don’t leave me alone with her.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Harriet.</i> Once more, sir, let me thank you for your
kindness.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> (<i>Avoiding her.</i>) Thank me, indeed! Oh! if
you knew—</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Harriet.</i> But why that angry look? Would you
abandon us? In your friendship, and my husband’s
love, is now my only hope.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> What touching accents! I never before—’Twas
with tones like these the serpent must have
seduced my poor innocent boy. (<i>Severely.</i>) It is my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>duty, miss—my duty, madam, to remind you that the step
you have taken is—(<i>She looks abashed.</i>)—Not that I
would say anything to give you pain, but—tell me who
you are, my dear.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Harriet.</i> The daughter of Colonel Mowbray, who,
dying five years ago, left me without fortune, without
friends, without a protector. I sought an asylum in the
neighbouring village, and soon afterwards became acquainted
with Mr. Eustace. You know his worth, and
can you wonder if—</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> Poor thing! Well, don’t weep, my dear;
your cares will soon be at an end. Not but that so imprudent
a step as a clandestine marriage deserves the
severest—(<i>As she appears affected, he relaxes in the
severity of his manner.</i>) Yet you were very young,
and that almost excuses you. But how appease his
father?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Harriet.</i> I dread to meet him.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> And I too, who must bear the responsibility
of all this! But how did my Charles contrive to make
your acquaintance? I watched him so closely, that—</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Harriet.</i> I believe, sir, he bribed the servants to
conceal his absence from home; and whilst you thought
he was in his own room, closely engaged in his studies,
he used to—</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> The mischievous<a id='tn018'></a> truant! I’ll trim him for
this. I beg pardon; I forgot I was speaking to you of
a husband.—Ah! I can imagine by what arts he won
your affections. He has often delighted me. He solved
some difficult problem in Euclid for you, perhaps—talked
Latin to you, eh? or Greek?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Harriet.</i> Greek, sir! he merely said he loved me.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> Where could he have picked up that! I never
taught it him. But I always said the dear boy was
blessed with a natural genius. And so you have
taken advantage of his father’s absence, to get
married?</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span><i>Harriet.</i> No, sir; we have been married these four
years.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> Four years!</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Harriet.</i> Yet have I often lamented my imprudence.
His wife, yet not as such acknowledged, and exposed
to the evil opinion of the inhabitants of the village, I
was at the point of quitting the place, till Charles
could openly avow our union. The departure of his
father determined him to afford me a temporary refuge
here, but his unexpected return has—(<i>A bell heard.</i>)</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> The supper bell! To avoid suspicion, I must
leave you, and join old Mr. Eustace.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Harriet.</i> Leave me! and Charles not here.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> Possibly he is detained by his father. What
is to be done? You must not be seen here, or—(<i>After
some hesitation, and with a profound sigh</i>) Ah! there
is no other resource. Go into this room; it is mine;
when the family shall have retired for the night, I’ll
contrive to let you out of the house, and you may
remain concealed in the village till we can obtain the
sanction of your—your father-in-law.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Harriet.</i> I will do all you desire, sir.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> There, be quick; should you be discovered
there, it would be my ruin. (<i>He puts her into the room,
and as he is speaking to her through the door, which
he holds ajar<a id='tn019'></a>.</i>)</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> (<i>Alarmed.</i>) Who’s there?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Molly.</i> (<i>Looking slyly at him.</i>) ’Tis I, Mr. Pollypot,

you say? Were you saying “good bye” to anybody?</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span><i>Poly.</i> No—I—I was talking to myself.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Molly.</i> Oh! then you are your own little dear.
“Don’t open to any one but me, my little dear.”</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> (<i>Aside.</i>) The little imp has overheard us.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Molly.</i> An’t you ashamed of yourself, Mr. Ignoramus?
You preach one thing and practise another. You
would turn away a couple of poor servants because
they love one another honestly, whilst you have a pretty
dear concealed in your apartment. But master is come
home now, and he shall know of this. (<i>Calls.</i>) Master!
master! Mr. Eustace!—</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> Molly, Molly, ’tis all a mistake—listen to me—</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Molly.</i> No; you had no pity for me just now; so as
you said, you shall find me as flexible as the worst
Plutus.—Master!—</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> I supplicate—I implore—you shall stay, Molly,
you shall stay.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Molly.</i> I stay in a house where there are such doings!
No, no. But I’ll have my revenge on you before I go,
I will.—Master! Mr. Charles! all the house! come

you, Mr. Polyglot, didn’t you hear the supper bell?
The fish is getting cold, and—</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Molly.</i> He doesn’t care about your fish, master; he
has fish of his own to fry, the wicked old sinner.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Eustace.</i> What does the girl mean?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Molly.</i> I mean, master, that if one serpent, as he
calls me, is to be sent out of your house, to let you
know that you have another remaining in it.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> Molly, my dear—</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Molly.</i> Don’t whisper me; I’m not to be come over
with soft words, that I can tell you. Here’s Mr. Tutorer,
sir, who would turn away a poor lass for having an

locked up in his room.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Eustace.</i> Why, how dare you accuse—</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Molly.</i> It is true enough, sir; and if it is not a
woman, may I never be married! and I would not
swear such a dreadful oath to a fib.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Eustace.</i> A woman!</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> (<i>Aside.</i>) I don’t know whether I am standing
on my head or my heels.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Eustace.</i> Is this true, sir?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> I—you can’t believe—you would not suspect—</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Molly.</i> There’s no need to suspect, master, for it is
true. ’Tis his little dear, for I heard him call her so.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Eustace.</i> The girl’s earnestness convinces me there
is some truth in this. Your consternation now—your

<p class='c014'><i>Eustace.</i> In a word, sir, who have you concealed

<p class='c014'><i>Eustace.</i> No matter; I’ll force it open.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Molly.</i> Stop, master; I have a key. (<i>Gives three

<p class='c014'><i>Eustace.</i> What, Charles!</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> (<i>Aside.</i>) How came he there?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Eustace.</i> What were you doing there? and why
did not you come out at once?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Charles.</i> The fact is, sir, I have been so unfortunate
as to displease my tutor. He has kindly promised to
conceal my offence from you, till he can hope to obtain
your pardon for it. I heard your voice in anger, and
dreading the effects of an abrupt disclosure, I—</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Eustace.</i> (<i>To Poly.</i>) So, that was it, after all?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> Yes—after all.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Eustace.</i> And what is his offence? a serious one, no
doubt, to require so much mystery.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Charles.</i> (<i>To Poly.</i>) Remember your oath.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> For the present I must conceal it. I am
bound by an——by a promise.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Eustace.</i> Well—(<i>To Molly.</i>) And how dare you,
you little <a id='tn022-2'></a>hussy, tell me such a rhodomontade?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Molly.</i> (<i>Confused.</i>) Why, master,—I only told
you what I thought. (<i>Aside.</i>) I’ll not give it up yet.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span><i>Eustace.</i> Come, Mr. Polyglot, to supper.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> I have no appetite, thank you; and am rather
unwell.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Molly.</i> (<i>Aside.</i>) Guilty conscience.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Eustace.</i> You look ill. Robin shall bring you something
into your own room.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Charles.</i> (<i>Aside.</i>) And my wife there!</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Eustace.</i> Come with me, Charles. Good night
Mr. Polyglot: pardon my suspicion, my worthy friend.
(<i>To Molly.</i>) Do you go to bed, and let me hear no
more of that chattering little tongue of <a id='tn023'></a>yours to-night.
Robin! go lock the outer doors, bring me the keys,
and then take some supper to Mr. Polyglot.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Charles.</i> (<i>Aside.</i>) Then there will be no escape
for her.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Eustace.</i> Come, Charles, come.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> Is this a dream! Let me collect my scattered
senses. Surely it cannot be? Married! My pupil who
had never, as I thought, even so much as——O Lord!
absolutely married! And I, Ignatius Polyglot, who
have led the life of a hermit, to be suspected! I must
not think; I’ll retire to rest. Heaven knows I have
need of it. (<i>Approaches the door, and hastily retires.</i>)
Bless us and save us! I forgot, she is there! And how
am I to get her away? Hark! They are locking the
outer gate. There is now no hope.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Harriet.</i> At length you are alone. Tell me what
is now to be done? Counsel me—advise me.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> Yes, I—how shall I advise you? Advise me
what I had best—at any rate you must not remain here.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span><i>Harriet.</i> Where would you have me go?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> Wherever you please, my good young lady;
but it is night, you know—these are my apartments,
and after the suspicions that have been excited against
me, I—yet how can I get you away? They have closed
the doors and—but what ails you?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Harriet.</i> Reach me a chair. My agitation for the
last hour has so——I am fainting.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> Don’t think of such a thing—I know not how
to help you—’tis not at all in my way. (<i>He leads her
to a chair; her bonnet falls off.</i>) This was wanting
to complete the pleasures of the evening. My dear
lady—Miss—My kind madam, (<i>Taps her hand.</i>) If
any one should come! She recovers. Be composed—It
occurs to me that I have a key of the little wicket
that leads from the garden to the meadow; that way
we may reach the village.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Harriet.</i> Conduct me where you will. But I must
take my dear Frederick with me.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> Frederick! what’s Frederick?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Harriet.</i> Our darling boy.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> (<i>Stammering.</i>) And have you a darling boy?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Harriet.</i> He is in the room I have occupied at the
end of the garden.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> O Charles! Charles! In love—married—a
little boy! Have I any thing more to learn? tell me at
once.—So then, I have been tutor to a father of a
family!</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Harriet.</i> I can easily bring him away. (<i>Going.</i>)</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> No; you might be observed. There is but
one thing to be done—I foresee my fate—Since I must
be the scape-goat, I’ll fetch him for you.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Harriet.</i> My kind friend!</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> I’ll not be gone an instant. (<i>Noise of footsteps.</i>)
Ha! here comes Robin. Quick—retire. (<i>She
goes towards the room.</i>) No, not there. He’ll want to
go into that room with my supper. There—there. (<i>He</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span><i>forces her into the room on the opposite side—a lock

</div>

<p class='c014'><i>Robin.</i> I have brought your supper, sir.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> Leave it, leave it. And you, Mrs. Molly, what
do you want here? (<i>Robin takes the tray into the room.</i>)</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Molly.</i> (<i>Slyly</i>) I came to ask whether I should clear
away the broken glass yonder. Why, now, if there isn’t
some conjuration there? You told Master Eustace the
key was inside the door, and see if it hasn’t opened of
itself. (<i>Aside.</i>) Then I was right after all.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> Ahem! you may go—you may go.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Molly.</i> I hope, sir, you’ll forgive my suspicions. (<i>Sees
the bonnet.</i>) O, ho!</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> Begone I say! and, in future, beware how
you accuse an innocent person.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Molly.</i> Yes, sir, if you please; and I repent it the
more, seeing, as I do, the proofs of your innocence
before me.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> Light my lanthorn. (<i>To Robin, who returns.</i>)
I am going to walk.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Robin.</i> At this time, sir; and in such weather?
Why it is pouring of rain.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> No matter—I—I have a head-ache and want
air. Begone! both of you, and woe be to you if I find
either of you here at my return! (<i>They go off.</i>) There
is not an instant to be lost. The poor innocent baby
must not become a victim to the old man’s displeasure;
and if he should reach the pavilion before me—Into
what a labyrinth has my affection for my pupil led me!</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Robin.</i> Why, what would you be at now?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Molly.</i> She’s here; I’m sure of it.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span><i>Robin.</i> Who’s here?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Molly<a id='tn026'></a>.</i> Mr. Ignoramus’s Miss.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Robin.</i> I’ll not go and tell master any such thing.
You know you have got into one scrape already this
evening by telling a fib.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Molly.</i> But this time I have proof positive<a id='tn026-2'></a>. (<i>Takes
up the bonnet.</i>) Look here.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Robin.</i> Why, that does look rather queer, to be
sure. But what does that signify? Depend upon it,
she’s gone.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Molly.</i> How can that be? Haven’t I been watching
outside? Besides, the gates are locked.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Robin.</i> Where can she be then?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Molly.</i> There! I hear her move. Run, quick;
fetch master.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Robin.</i> And yet I don’t like to tell upon old tutorer,
neither.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Molly.</i> Wouldn’t he have told upon us? But we’ll
let master see what a sly old fox he has got in his
house. Go, I tell you. (<i>Forces him off.</i>) Now,
Mr. Pollypot, I’ll teach you something better than
Greek, I will. Ah! here comes Mr. Charles. He’ll
be delighted at this, for the tutorer leads the poor lad
such a life, that he’ll be glad enough to get quit of him,
I warrant me.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Charles.</i> My anxiety is insupportable; and at all

<p class='c014'><i>Molly.</i> O, sir, I have such news for you! You are
the only one in the house who is kind to me, and now
I’ll prove my gratitude. I’ll soon get the tutorer
turned away, and make you your own master.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Charles.</i> What do you mean?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Molly.</i> I have discovered it at last. She is here
after all.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Charles.</i> Is the girl out of her senses?</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span><i>Molly.</i> No, no; here’s proof! here’s the creature’s
bonnet; and I’ve sent Robin to bring your father here.</p>

have you done!</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Molly.</i> Lord, Mr. Charles, what ails you?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Charles.</i> Alas! you know not the mischief you
have effected. ’Tis not he who is to blame; he has
interfered but to serve me: the lady, who is here concealed,
is my wife.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Molly.</i> (<i>With mingled astonishment and grief.</i>)
Your wife!</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Charles.</i> This precipitate disclosure has rendered
abortive our hopes of obtaining pardon from my father.
Your malicious curiosity has destroyed the happiness
of us all.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Molly.</i> (<i>Bursting into tears.</i>) O, Mr. Charles, indeed,
indeed, if I had but known——you, who are so
good, so kind——. But dont’ee grieve, dont’ee now.
I’ll die rather than harm you.—I’ll take all the blame
upon myself.—There may yet be time; I’ll run and

<p class='c014'><i>Robin.</i> Yes, sir, Molly says you may now be convinced.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Eustace.</i> So. You here, Charles?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Charles.</i> Yes, sir, I—I heard a noise, and was
fearful——</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Eustace.</i> ’Tis well; stay where you are: the scene
you are about to witness will serve you as a lesson
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>which may last you your life. (<i>To Robin and Molly.</i>)
As for you, if you have called me out of my bed by
another such a rigmarole as the last,——</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Robin.</i> O, no, sir, it is all sure enough this time.
(<i>To Molly, who makes signs to him.</i>) I had trouble
enough to persuade master, but he is come at last,
you see.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Molly.</i> Well, and what for?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Robin.</i> What for! Why, to be sure, you know well
enough. The lady, you know.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Molly.</i> What lady? What is the simpleton talking
about?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Robin.</i> Why the lady that is concealed here.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Molly.</i> Robin, you have been at the ale-barrel.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Robin.</i> O, the little gipsey! Didn’t you tell me,—</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Molly.</i> No, it isn’t true.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Robin.</i> Well, hang me but——. And I suppose
you’ll say you didn’t send me to bring master.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Molly.</i> To be sure I will, for it’s false.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Robin.</i> And that bonnet—</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Molly.</i> (<i>Putting it on.</i>) It is mine. Master, there
ben’t a true word in all he is telling you. (<i>Pinches
his arm.</i>) Can’t you hold your tongue.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Robin.</i> Oh!—that isn’t the way to make me.
Master, I say again——</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Molly.</i> And I say, Master,——</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Eustace.</i> Hold your tongues, both of you. There
is some mystery here. The evident alarm of that
girl—(<i>To Molly, who is about to speak.</i>) Silence!
(<i>Takes a candle, and looks into the room at the left
hand.</i>)</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Charles.</i> I almost sink with dread.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Molly.</i> (<i>To Robin.</i>) I’ve a great mind never to
marry you for this.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Eustace.</i> (<i>Returns.</i>) No one there. (<i>Goes to the
opposite door<a id='tn028'></a>.</i>) The door is locked. (<i>Gives three taps.</i>)</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Harriet.</i> (<i>Within.</i>) Is that my kind protector?</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span><i>Eustace.</i> (<i>Staggering away.</i>) Her kind protector!
’Tis but too true, then! The old hypocrite! thus to

<span class='sc'>Frederick</span> <i>is concealed under his cloak. He goes

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> (<i>In an under tone.</i>) Open—open quickly—’tis
I. I have secured our precious charge. Now, quick;

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><i>Enter</i> <span class='sc'>Harriet</span>.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'><i>Eustace.</i> You are right, for old Argus has you.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Harriet.</i> O, heavens! I’m lost! (<i>Robin lights the
candles.</i>)</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Eustace.</i> No, madam, you are found. And you!
Is it thus you repay the confidence I have reposed in
you? Are you the man I have selected as a guide, as
a monitor to my son? A female concealed in your
apartment!</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Charles.</i> My dear father, I must no longer allow—</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Eustace.</i> Peace! And what is it you are endeavouring
to hide there?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> Nothing—a mere trifle.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Eustace.</i> I insist upon knowing. (<i>Draws open his
cloak and discovers Master Frederick.</i>) You call this
a trifle do you?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Harriet.</i> (<i>Running towards him.</i>) My Frederick!
my child!</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Eustace.</i> O!—Now what have you to say for
yourself?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> That it <i>is</i> a Frederick—a child I mean,—I
confess; but suffer me to explain, and——</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span><i>Eustace.</i> Explanation is needless: your—mere trifle—explains
itself. And yet I would hope you are
not the monster you appear. Answer me one question:
Is the lady your wife?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> No, no; yet if you would only——</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Eustace.</i> The unblushing sinner! Then, will you
marry her?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> (<i>To Charles.</i>) I have done and suffered much
to serve you: I can’t do that, you know.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Eustace.</i> Do you hesitate?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Charles.</i> Will you but listen to me, sir?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Eustace<a id='tn030'></a>.</i> No, I will listen to but one thing only.
(<i>To Poly.</i>) When a man has committed an error, is
it not his first duty to do what he can to repair it?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> Granted.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Eustace.</i> To restore her respectability to the woman
he has betrayed?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> Granted.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Eustace.</i> To protect and bestow his name upon his
child.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> Granted. (<i>To Charles, who is about to interrupt
him.</i>) Further concealment is impossible. (<i>To
Eustace<a id='tn030-2'></a>.</i>) But suppose his family should refuse——</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Eustace.</i> Refuse! In such a case, no honest member
of it would refuse to sanction the union; if he did,
he would share in the guilt of the offender.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> I am quite of your opinion.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Eustace.</i> Then why hesitate?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> The lady is already married; but if you
would just have the kindness to repeat to your son
all you have said to me——</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Eustace.</i> My son!</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Charles.</i> Yes, sir; we throw ourselves at your feet,
and implore your pardon. This lady is my wife.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Eustace.</i> How! married! without consulting me!
Leave me, ungrateful boy!</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span><i>Charles.</i> Will not the choice I have made procure
your forgiveness, sir!</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> Let me intercede for them. Remember the
lecture you have just delivered to me. Practice what
you preach. Besides, you can’t unmarry them, you
know.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Eustace.</i> And when I had another scheme in view
for him?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> It is all as it should be. You wished him to
marry—what can it signify?—there he is, without farther
ado, ready married to your hands.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Robin.</i> You save the trouble and expense<a id='tn031'></a> of a
wedding.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Harriet.</i> You have a daughter who will love you.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Molly.</i> And a little grandson ready made, master.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Eustace.</i> But the example——</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Molly.</i> ’Tis a good one, master; and, if you please,
Robin and I will follow it.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Eustace.</i> Well—well—since it is so: but there is a
little urchin who, I foresee, will one of these days play
us a similar trick.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Poly.</i> Never fear: place him under my care—you
know me; and I give him twenty years’ notice, that if
he too should attempt to elude my vigilance—Ah me!
as I have done for the father, so shall I doubtless be
induced to do for the son; and I trust to your indulgence
for my re-appearance in the character of—<span class='sc'>Scape-Goat</span>.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

    Chief Executive and Director
    gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
